2. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL
3. Open IntelliJ on your computer
4. Click "Get from VCS" in the top right-hand corner
5. Paste the URL and clone the repo

## Importing the project to IntelliJ from a ZIP file
1. Download the ZIP file from the repo start page, under "Code"
2. Unzip the file
3. Open IntelliJ on your computer

## Running the program
To run the program, please ensure you have set up the correct IP address in the `Config` class.
Any other collaborators must add the same IP address to their `Config` class.
Then, the host first runs `serverMain` and the clients run `clientMain`.

If you are running the program on the same computer as the server, you can run the program as localhost using
`127.0.0.1`.
Similarly, first run `serverMain` and then run `clientMain`.
